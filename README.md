1. **Install the Azure PowerShell module** (if not already installed):
   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

2. **Authenticate to Azure**:
   ```powershell
   Connect-AzAccount
   ```

3. **Script to download Azure Defender for Cloud alerts for all subscriptions with logging and verbose output**:
   ```powershell
   # Enable verbose output
   $VerbosePreference = "Continue"

   # Authenticate to Azure
   Write-Verbose "Authenticating to Azure..."
   Connect-AzAccount

   # Get all subscriptions
   Write-Verbose "Retrieving all subscriptions..."
   $subscriptions = Get-AzSubscription

   # Initialize an array to store the Defender for Cloud alerts
   $defenderAlerts = @()

   foreach ($subscription in $subscriptions) {
       Write-Verbose "Processing subscription: $($subscription.Name) ($($subscription.Id))"
       # Set the subscription context
       Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $subscription.Id

       # Get all Defender for Cloud alerts for the subscription
       Write-Verbose "Retrieving Defender for Cloud alerts for subscription: $($subscription.Name) ($($subscription.Id))"
       $alerts = Get-AzSecurityAlert

       foreach ($alert in $alerts) {
           Write-Verbose "Processing alert: $($alert.AlertDisplayName)"
           # Add the alert to the array
           $defenderAlerts += [pscustomobject]@{
               SubscriptionId     = $subscription.Id
               AlertDisplayName   = $alert.AlertDisplayName
               AlertType          = $alert.AlertType
               Severity           = $alert.Severity
               Status             = $alert.Status
               ReportedTimeUtc    = $alert.ReportedTimeUtc
               Description        = $alert.Description
               RemediationSteps   = $alert.RemediationSteps
           }
       }
   }

   # Export the Defender for Cloud alerts to a CSV file
   $outputFile = "DefenderForCloud_Alerts.csv"
   Write-Verbose "Exporting alerts to $outputFile"
   $defenderAlerts | Export-Csv -Path $outputFile -NoTypeInformation

   Write-Host "Defender for Cloud alerts have been exported to $outputFile"
   ```

### Explanation:

1. **Enable Verbose Output**: The script sets `$VerbosePreference` to "Continue" to enable verbose output.

2. **Verbose Logging**: Throughout the script, `Write-Verbose` statements are added to log key actions and states. This includes authentication, retrieving subscriptions, setting context, retrieving alerts, processing each alert, and exporting data.

3. **Export to CSV**: The script exports the collected Defender for Cloud alerts to a CSV file named `DefenderForCloud_Alerts.csv`.

This script will now provide detailed logging information when run with the `-Verbose` flag, which can help you debug and understand the execution flow better.
