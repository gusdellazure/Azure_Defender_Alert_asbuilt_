o create a PowerShell script that detects and downloads all Azure Defender for Cloud alerts for all Azure subscriptions and exports the data to a spreadsheet (CSV format), you can use the Azure PowerShell module. Here's a script to accomplish this:

Install the Azure PowerShell module (if not already installed):

Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
Authenticate to Azure:

Connect-AzAccount
Script to download Azure Defender for Cloud alerts for all subscriptions:

PowerShell
# Authenticate to Azure
Connect-AzAccount

# Get all subscriptions
$subscriptions = Get-AzSubscription

# Initialize an array to store the Defender for Cloud alerts
$defenderAlerts = @()

foreach ($subscription in $subscriptions) {
    # Set the subscription context
    Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $subscription.Id

    # Get all Defender for Cloud alerts for the subscription
    $alerts = Get-AzSecurityAlert

    foreach ($alert in $alerts) {
        # Add the alert to the array
        $defenderAlerts += [pscustomobject]@{
            SubscriptionId     = $subscription.Id
            AlertDisplayName   = $alert.AlertDisplayName
            AlertType          = $alert.AlertType
            Severity           = $alert.Severity
            Status             = $alert.Status
            ReportedTimeUtc    = $alert.ReportedTimeUtc
            Description        = $alert.Description
            RemediationSteps   = $alert.RemediationSteps
        }
    }
}

# Export the Defender for Cloud alerts to a CSV file
$defenderAlerts | Export-Csv -Path "DefenderForCloud_Alerts.csv" -NoTypeInformation

Write-Host "Defender for Cloud alerts have been exported to DefenderForCloud_Alerts.csv"
Explanation:
Authenticate to Azure: The script starts by authenticating to Azure using Connect-AzAccount.

Get All Subscriptions: It retrieves all subscriptions associated with your account using Get-AzSubscription.

Set Subscription Context: For each subscription, the script sets the context to that subscription using Set-AzContext.

Get Defender for Cloud Alerts: It retrieves all Defender for Cloud alerts for the subscription using Get-AzSecurityAlert.

Store Alerts: The script stores the Defender for Cloud alerts in an array.

Export to CSV: Finally, it exports the collected Defender for Cloud alerts to a CSV file named DefenderForCloud_Alerts.csv.

This script ensures that all subscriptions associated with your account are processed, and Defender for Cloud alerts are exported to a CSV file.# RBAC_Assigment_asbuilt_
